A new version of SBA-1 condensed into a single page through the power of DOM manipulation. This project was made using a 1920x1080 resolution monitor and may not display as intended on other screen sizes.

The sandwich or cake may be clicked to display 3 sandwiches or desserts, respectively, at the bottom of the page. Typing either "Sandwich" or "Cake" into the field in the center of the page will change the background image and background color. There is also music that plays depending on the input. Autoplayed music may be blocked by the browser, and will need to be enabled by the user.
